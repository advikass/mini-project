				Eddie Munson, leader of the Hellfire Club, Hawkins High School's Dungeons & Dragons group, becomes a prime suspect in the murders after senior cheerleading captain Chrissy Cunningham dies in his trailer. Dustin Henderson, Lucas and Erica Sinclair, Max Mayfield, Steve Harrington, Nancy Wheeler, and Robin Buckley begin investigating to clear Eddie's name. They discover that the true perpetrator is a powerful being who resides in the Upside Down, whom they later dub "Vecna".

                    Stranger Things is an American science fiction horror drama television series created by the Duffer Brothers for Netflix.</p> 
					<p class="text-muted">Produced by Monkey Massacre Productions and 21 Laps Entertainment, the first season was released on Netflix on July 15, 2016. The second and third season followed in October 2017 and July 2019, and the fourth season aired in two parts in May and July 2022. In February 2022, Stranger Things was renewed for a fifth and final season.

                    The season was met with positive reviews, with critics praising the performances, the visuals, action sequences, realistic themes, soundtrack, emotional weight, and the darker, more mature tone, though some criticized it for being overstuffed due to the lengthier episode runtimes.

The second plotline involves Mike Wheeler visiting Eleven, Will and Jonathan Byers at their new home in California. Due to the events in Hawkins and the imminent danger to her friends, Eleven goes with Dr. Sam Owens to a secret facility in Nevada to regain her powers, where she is reunited with Dr. Martin Brenner and forced to confront her past in Hawkins National Laboratory with the aid of an isolation tank. With the military searching for Eleven, Mike, Will, Jonathan, and new friend Argyle try to track her down first.
In a flashback to 1979, Dr. Martin Brenner is experimenting on children possessing supernatural abilities until a mysterious incident kills all of the children except Eleven. In 1986 — eight months after the events at Starcourt Mall — the Byers and Eleven have moved to California, where Eleven struggles with the loss of her powers and is bullied by other students.</p>
<p class="text-muted">Joyce receives a porcelain doll in the mail, seemingly from Russia, and finds a hidden note stating that Jim Hopper is alive. In Hawkins, Mike Wheeler, Dustin Henderson, and Lucas Sinclair have joined Hawkins High School's "Hellfire Club," a Dungeons & Dragons club led by iconoclast Eddie Munson. Though Lucas implores Mike and Dustin to attend his basketball team's championship, the two instead recruit Erica Sinclair to take his place within Eddie's campaign. Meanwhile, Max Mayfield, who has broken up with Lucas, reluctantly attends counseling sessions to cope with Billy Hargrove's death and its reverberations. Chrissy Cunningham, captain of the Hawkins High School cheer squad, is haunted by visions of her abusive mother and a chiming grandfather clock. While buying drugs from Eddie, Chrissy is possessed and killed by a sentient humanoid figure from her visions.
In a flashback, Hopper is shown to have survived the explosion underneath Starcourt Mall, but was captured and sent to a prison camp by Soviet soldiers in Kamchatka. Joyce and Murray Bauman call the phone number on the note sent to Joyce and speak with "Enzo," revealed to be Dmitri Antonov, a prison guard that Hopper has bribed. Antonov instructs them to deliver a $40,000 ransom to his contact in Alaska. Mike flies to California to visit Eleven, but their reunion is ruined as he and Will witness a gang, led by Angela, bully her at Rink-o-Mania. Mike and Will also argue about the growing rift in their friendship.
 Eleven eventually retaliates by striking Angela in the face with a roller skate.</p>

 Back in Hawkins, Max tells Dustin she saw Eddie and Chrissy enter his trailer shortly before Chrissy died, with Eddie running away in terror. As the police suspect Eddie, Max and Dustin race to find him first. With help from Robin and Steve, they locate the traumatized Eddie and explain the Upside Down to him; Eddie and Dustin name the entity that killed Chrissy "Vecna." Nancy and her fellow student reporter Fred investigate Chrissy's death. Eddie's uncle tells Nancy he believes the killer is Victor Creel, a Hawkins resident who was institutionalized after allegedly murdering his family in the 1950s. Fred is lured into the woods by visions of a student he accidentally killed in a car crash before Vecna murders him.
 Dr. Sam Owens is visited by U.S. Army Lt. Col. Jack Sullivan, who believes Eleven is responsible for Chrissy's death.</p>
 <p class="text-muted">Mike and Eleven argue after she points out his reluctance to say he loves her. Shortly after, Eleven is arrested for assaulting Angela, but is intercepted by Owens, who explains that Hawkins is in grave danger and that he has been working on a program to help bring her powers back. Plagued by the fear that she is the monster, and hoping to prove herself wrong, Eleven agrees to go with him. Joyce and Murray fly to Alaska to deliver the ransom for Hopper. In the prison camp, Hopper bribes a fellow inmate to break his shackles with a sledgehammer, plotting an escape. Nancy reunites with Dustin, Max, Steve, and Robin, and the group begins speculating about Vecna's connection to Chrissy and Fred, as well as Vecna's identity. Nancy and Robin go to the library to look up information about Victor Creel and discover that Creel blamed his family's murders on a demon, which Nancy and Robin conclude must be Vecna. Chrissy's boyfriend Jason leads the basketball team and Lucas on a hunt for Eddie, believing he killed Chrissy. Lucas lures them to a false hideout before running to warn the gang. Max recalls that Chrissy visited the school counselor before being killed by Vecna, and she, Dustin, and Steve break into the counselor's office. From reading Chrissy and Fred's files, Max learns that they suffered from PTSD symptoms similar to hers. Suddenly, Max hears Vecna call her name and envisions a grandfather clock.</p>
